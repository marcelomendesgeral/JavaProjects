# JavaProjects

Hello Everybody! I've been developing in Java since the graduate and my projects were only in my home machine or work...
Now I'm moving here and organizing everything... I hope you enjoy my dumb codes and send me your comments you want... 
I'll be gratefull for any contribution here!

Make yourself at home!

My best regards,

Marcelo Mendes
